### Project Notes ###


-------

- 1. fix - display_menu method to correctly show options
- 1.1 fix - initial response to correctly show welcome message
- 2. add feature - do not show display_menu for the second time 
2.1 instead make it one of the options to show menu again 
3. investigate and fix - ls is entered -> good output and then bad command is entered -> good output\
but after that if I enter ls -> bad output
4. investigate and fix - when user sends Ctrl+C the name is still in dictionary -> other users can't use the name
Additionally leaves a security hole. Detect that the user is disconnected and delete it from local DB
***try xxx except ConnectionResetError: delete user from DB***
5. fix - the case when username is already taken
- 6. fix - the app freezes when Enter is sent
- 7. fix - graceful disconnect - no double messages
8. fix - change username doesn't work

change every isinstance to type()

define session_manager instances in dictionary and in each cmanager

declare function in session manager
keep in check:
- states

create two types of function initalize_communication - with arg - message and without

-------

# deal with session_manager and creating client_client connections

# create a class/ static method to instantiate a class (so that handler connected to 
# 'connect' can be run as handler() without changing syntax,
# a little twicking with arguments should be enough). And then I can simply handle everything inside session_manager

# implement threads
# create a method check_username instead of big chunk in method create_connections

# push this code to github (include multiple versions like udp, p2p etc.)
# include WireShark studies

# grow this into a web application with DataBase and Proper Backend

# implement client to client connections -> update cmanager to include current_session, implement universal method for talking in ses_manager

# rename everything in accordance with PEP8


-------------------------
# create several implementations of storage - text files, databases, dicitonaries
# use os module to retreive current time
# implement broadcasts
# groups
# data bases






### Do in a Week ### 
#  
# identification
# add this to gitHub after completed
# list of clients in dictionary like get-lists
# broadcast messages
# direct messages

### Further Exploration ###
# Databases
# History of chat
# containers
# log in services (passwords, encyption)
# Add ENCRYPTION

### Containers Presentation ###
# include all I already know:
#       role of native kernel/ vm in containers
#       Docker Architecture, docker-compose, Images, Dockerfiles, Repos
#       K8s Clusters, Services, Deployments, Pods, Architecture
#       Document everything you do, links, screenshots etc

### Additional ###
# update resume with relevant info about Linux (book) and Containers (running K8s cluster)
